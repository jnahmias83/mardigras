      <h5>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h5>
      <img
        class="img-about pt05"
        src="images/MondoKayo07StChasC.jpg"
      />
      <p class="p_about">
        The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including
        the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two
        weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
        (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is
        one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several
        large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the
        last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events
        occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including
        parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).
        <br /><br />
        The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as
        krewes; most follow the same parade schedule and route each year. The
        earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
        earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several
        modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
        events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming
        celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus
        (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the
        Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe.
        Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common
        throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated
        plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major
        krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

        />

        <p class="p_about">
          While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon
          Street, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts
          and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the
          upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the
          Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the
          Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi
          Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of
          the Courts" between Rex and Comus.[1]
          <br /><br />
          The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at
          the mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower Plaquemines
          Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their
          men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The
          date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is
          unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music
          and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt |
          A Company Man - The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of
          Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of
          masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes
          prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions
          were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de
          Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised money to
          fund an official Mardi Gras celebration.

      <p class="p_about">
        LaToya Cantrell left her hometown in 1990 to settle in Louisiana and
        study at Xavier University, where she obtained a degree in sociology.
        <br /><br />
        Following the extensive damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, she was
        temporarily evacuated to Houston. Anxious to invest in rebuilding the
        city and in particular its district of Broadmoor through the association
        for which she worked before the disaster. This reconstruction work
        materialized in particular through investment in the neighborhood
        library, then devastated despite its place at the heart of the urban
        renewal project. Installed in a new building, this place will keep part
        of its name and will open its doors again in March 2012 under the name
        of Rosa F. Keller Library and Community Center.
        <br /><br />
        In December 2012, she was elected to the New Orleans City Council and
        was re-elected in 2014.
        <br /><br />
        In March 2017, she announced her candidacy for the position of mayor of
        the city to succeed Mitch Landrieu. The following November 18, she was
        elected by obtaining 60.4% of the votes against her opponent Desiree
        Charbonnet4. On May 7, 2018, she took office, becoming the city's first
        female mayor. She was re-elected for a second term on November 13, 2021
        with 64.7% of the vote.
